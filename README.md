## Username

## Description 
I have created a command-line application that will create a professional looking README.md which returns the user's input. Using node index.js in the terminal, the user will be prompted with questions about their project which will be automatically generated onto a README.md file upon completion of the questionaire.

## Usage 
This project allows the user to save valuable time that would usually be spent creating the README.md file from scratch and leave more time for coding!
